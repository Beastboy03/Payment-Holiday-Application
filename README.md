# Payment-Holiday-Application
Given the Data of the applicants.
This model decides individuals that will have their payment holiday applications granted.
We need to ensure that payment holidays do not erode the value of the amounts owed.
We should grant this privilege to clients who have taken advantage of the various products that we offer. 
One of those services includes a current account. This enables us in tracking and understanding the cashflow of the clientâ€™s account; providing us insight into whether they are responsible and control their spending. 
Provide these privileges to clients who have been banking with us for a long duration of time. 
The age of the client should be 30 to 50-year-olds since they have a higher probability of being financially stable (the likelihood of defaults in lower for the age group).
The clients whose incomes were affected by the pandemic. This will ensure the clients who need the payment holiday the most receive it.


By using payment holidays, the bank will be able to minimise the number of defaults it will experience in the COVID-19 Pandemic.
Payment holidays will give the bank a good reputation as a company that prides itself in taking care of its clients
Payment holidays may, however, impact the cashflow of money in the bank
They will also mean that the bank will lose revenue for this particular financial year albeit the revenue will be recovered.

We prioritized clients that:
have good credit score fall within the 75th percentile
have not been defaulted.
Are our most loyal and trusted clients. Hence, the number of products used by the client is highly important for the process.
Our next important variable is the gross salary of the applicant. We have noticed that industries such as IT, Management and Finance earn a highly preferable income.
We need to ensure that our client is up to date with their installment to ensure that they value our services.
